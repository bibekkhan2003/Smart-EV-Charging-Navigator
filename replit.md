# EV Charging Optimization Platform

## Overview

This is an AI-powered EV charging optimization platform that combines real-time data analysis, route optimization, and demand prediction to help users find the most efficient charging stations. The system uses a Flask backend with A* pathfinding algorithm and LSTM neural networks for demand prediction, coupled with a Streamlit frontend for user interaction.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

### Frontend (Streamlit)
- **Technology**: Streamlit web framework
- **Purpose**: Provides an interactive web interface for users to search for charging stations, view maps, and get route optimization
- **Key Features**: 
  - Interactive maps using Folium
  - Data visualization with Plotly
  - Real-time station availability display
  - Route optimization interface

### Backend (Flask)
- **Technology**: Flask REST API
- **Purpose**: Serves as the main API server handling business logic and AI computations
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful API endpoints for station data and route optimization
  - Integration with ML algorithms
  - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

## Key Components

- **Purpose**: Calculates optimal routes between charging stations using A* algorithm
- **Features**:
  - Haversine distance calculation for accurate geographical measurements
  - Grid-based pathfinding with 1km resolution
  - 8-directional movement support

### 2. LSTM Demand Prediction
- **Location**: `backend/algorithms/lstm_model.py`

  - TensorFlow/Keras based neural network
  - Time series forecasting with 24-hour sequences
  - Synthetic data generation for training
  - MinMaxScaler for data normalization

### 3. Data Management
- **Location**: `backend/data/stations.py`
- **Purpose**: Manages charging station data with support for multiple cities
- **Features**:
  - Multi-city support (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, etc.)
  - External API integration capability
  - Realistic synthetic data generation when external APIs are unavailable

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- **Location**: `backend/utils/preprocessing.py`
- **Purpose**: Prepares and normalizes data for machine learning algorithms

  - Location coordinate normalization
  - Time series data preparation
  - Feature engineering for temporal patterns

## Data Flow

1. **User Request**: User interacts with Streamlit frontend to search for stations or request route optimization
2. **API Call**: Frontend makes HTTP requests to Flask backend API endpoints
3. **Data Processing**: Backend processes requests using appropriate algorithms (A* for routing, LSTM for predictions)
4. **Response**: Backend returns processed data (routes, predictions, station info) to frontend
5. **Visualization**: Frontend displays results using interactive maps and charts

## External Dependencies

### Python Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for frontend
- **Flask**: Backend web server
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for LSTM models
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive data visualization
- **Folium**: Map visualization
- **Requests**: HTTP client for API calls
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning utilities

### Optional External APIs
- **Google Maps API**: For real charging station data (when API key is provided)
- **OpenChargeMap**: Alternative source for charging station data

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Streamlit app running on default port (8501)
- **Backend**: Flask app running on localhost:8000
- **Communication**: HTTP requests between frontend and backend

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Backend and frontend are separate applications allowing for independent scaling and deployment
2. **Algorithm Choice**: A* algorithm chosen for route optimization due to its efficiency and optimality guarantees
3. **ML Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras selected for LSTM implementation due to its mature ecosystem and good performance
4. **Data Strategy**: Hybrid approach supporting both real API data and synthetic data generation for reliable operation
5. **Grid Resolution**: 1km grid size chosen for A* algorithm to balance accuracy and computational efficiency

### Key Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Each algorithm and data component is isolated in separate modules
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new cities, algorithms, or data sources
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful fallback to synthetic data when external APIs fail
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and data structures for real-time responses

### Potential Enhancements
- Database integration for persistent data storage
- User authentication and personalization
- Real-time data streaming from charging stations
- Mobile app development using the existing API
- Cloud deployment with containerization
